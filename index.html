        <div class="about-text">
            <p>My fascination with data initiated my journey into the world of technology. In studying data science, I have been able to go deep into the details of information analysis and interpretation, finding hidden patterns, and drawing meaningful insights from it. This strong analytical foundation has equipped me with a strong problem-solving mindset and an eye for detail-crucial skills in any field, particularly in the ever-evolving realm of technology.</p>
            <p> recently, I have taken the innovative direction into the realms of web and mobile application development. This now allows me to extend my expertise in data science toward an interactive translation of ideas into real applications. I am excited about using this skill in innovating solutions to make life easier and create value for people.</p>
            <p>This portfolio is going to develop and emphasize the growing Web and mobile development skills, bringing an idea into a functional, user-friendly application. I'm into learning and finding out what new stuff tech has to offer. This will merge into my background in data science, building emerging skills in web and mobile development to enable contribution to meaningful ends in technology for effective solutions that would make a difference.</p>
